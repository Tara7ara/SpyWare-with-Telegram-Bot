# Spyware Project with Telegram Bot for Windows  

This project was developed as part of a university cybersecurity assignment to demonstrate how basic programming knowledge can be used to create potentially harmful tools. Specifically, this project is a spyware with communication capabilities through a Telegram bot, designed specifically for the Windows operating system. The goal is to show how quickly and effectively such tools can be developed, even by individuals with basic programming knowledge.

## Project Objective  

The purpose of this project is twofold:  
1. **Demonstrate technical accessibility**: Show how a tool like spyware can be developed by anyone with basic programming skills, highlighting the importance of strengthening system security.  
2. **Analyze security implications**: Provide a controlled environment to understand how such tools work, assess the associated risks, and explore strategies to mitigate these threats.  

## Features  

- **Sensitive Data Capture**: Collects data such as keystrokes, screenshots, and other key system information.  
- **Communication via Telegram**: Uses a Telegram bot to securely send the collected data in real-time to a predefined channel.  
- **Windows Compatibility**: Specifically designed to operate in Windows environments, leveraging system features to run discreetly.  

## Disclaimer  

This project is intended solely for educational and research purposes. My intention is not to promote or encourage malicious activities, but rather to highlight the importance of understanding these threats to improve security practices. Remember that unauthorized use of this software is illegal and can lead to severe consequences. I strongly encourage responsible and ethical behavior in all cybersecurity rese
